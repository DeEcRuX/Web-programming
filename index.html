        <h2>Nepali New Year/<br>Bisket Jatra</h2>
        <h3>Nepali Calender : <span>वैशाख</span></h3>
        <h3>Solar Calender : <span>April-May</span></h3>
        <h4>Active Region : <span>Bhaktapur,Nationwide</span></h4>
        <p>The Nepali New Year, also known as "Bikram Sambat," is a time of renewal and reflection.
           As the old year comes to a close and a new one begins, it is an opportunity to let go of the past and embrace the
            possibilities of the future. The new year symbolizes a fresh start and the chance to live life with a renewed sense
             of purpose. It also serves as a reminder to be grateful for the blessings of the past year and to strive for growth 
             and self-improvement in the year to come. On this day, children (and many adults too!) offer sweets, 
             fruits and gifts to their mothers to show their respect. Those whose mothers have passed
              away visit Mata Tirtha in the west of Kathmandu, take a holy bath and make offerings in their mother’s memory.
        </p>
         <p>
             The New Year is always a lively time to be in Nepal, with mass celebrations taking place all over the country.
              A particularly lively place to spend the day is Bhaktapur, where the Bisket Jatra festival takes place.
               A huge chariot carrying the god Bhairab is pulled through the streets, ending with a chariot battle at Bhaktapur’s
                Khalna Tole.

        <h2>Buddha Jayanti</h2>
        <h3>Nepali Calender : <span>वैशाख / ज्येष्ठ</span></h3>
        <h3>Solar Calender : <span>May-June</span></h3>
        <h4>Active Region : <span>Swayambhunath, Bodhnath, Lumbini, Nationwide</span></h4>
        <p>
          The Lord Buddha’s birthday falls on the first full day of the first month of the Hindu lunar calendar, 
          and is celebrated by Hindus and Buddhists alike. It is observed at Buddhist shrines and monasteries throughout Nepal,
           but a particularly grand ceremony is held at Buddha’s birthplace in Lumbini. In Kathmandu, the Tibetan enclave of 
           Boudhanath is a particularly good place to watch the festivities.
        </p>
        <p>The Buddha Jayanti, also known as Vesak or Buddha Purnima, is the celebration of the birth, enlightenment, 
          and passing away of Lord Buddha. The philosophy behind Buddha Jayanti is to strive for inner peace, wisdom and compassion through 
          the path of non-violence and self-control. It is an opportunity to contemplate on the Four Noble Truths and the Eightfold
           Path, which are the foundations of Buddhism, and to work towards achieving the ultimate goal of Nirvana, or enlightenment. 
           It is a time to let go of our attachments and to focus on the present moment, to cultivate a 
           peaceful and content mind. Celebrating Buddha Jayanti is not just an annual event, but a reminder to live a meaningful life,
            by following the path of the Buddha.

            sustain us.The festival encourages us to reflect
             on our relationship with the environment.

        <h2>Naag Panchami</h2>
        <h3>Nepali Calender : <span>श्रावण</span></h3>
        <h3>Solar Calender : <span>July - August</span></h3>
        <h4>Active Region : <span>Nag Pokhari in Naxal, Taudaha, Nationwide</span></h4>
        <p>
          Naag Panchami falls right in the middle of the monsoon.Naag Panchami is usually celebrated on 
          the fifth day of the bright half of the lunar month of Shravana, which is considered to be an auspicious month in Hinduism.
           This Hindu festival worships the serpent god, Naag,
           and pictures of Naag are posted in doorways, as well as offerings of milk. It is believed that worshipping Naag 
           protects against snake bites. This festival marks respect to serpents as water guardians, and to ensure regular
            rainfall in the Kathmandu Valley.
        </p>
        <p> 
          Philosophically, the serpent symbolizes the power of energy that lies dormant within us all, waiting to be awakened. 
          It represents the kundalini energy, which when awakened, can lead to spiritual enlightenment. The festival of Naag Panchami
           serves as a reminder that within each of us is the potential for spiritual growth and transcendence, and it is up to us to tap 
           into that power and awaken our true selves.

        <h3>Solar Calender : <span>August - September</span></h3>
        <h4>Active Region : <span>Hilly Region,Nationwide</span></h4>
        <p>Janai Purnima is the Sacred Thread Festival, when Hindu men, especially the Brahmins and Chettris, 
          perform their annual change of Janai. Everyone who celebrates this festival puts a sacred thread around their wrist.

        <p>
          Janai Purnima is a Hindu festival that celebrates the sacred thread worn by men, known as the janai, 
          and symbolizes the bond between the individual self and the universal self. It is a day for self-reflection 
          and the reaffirmation of one's commitment to living a virtuous and meaningful life. The thread, worn around 
          the wrist, serves as a reminder to always strive towards spiritual growth and to live in harmony with the world around us.

        <h2>Gai Jatra</h2>
        <h3>Nepali Calender : <span>भाद्र</span></h3>
        <h3>Solar Calender : <span>August - September</span></h3>
        <h4>Active Region : <span>Kathmandu</span></h4>
        <p>Gai Jatra (literally meaning the festival of cows) is a fusion of three traditions that came 
          into being in three different periods of time. The first and the oldest tradition incorporates a cult and worship
           of the ancient god of death – Yamaraj. Despite the deathly theme, it is actually as time full of music, dancing
            and laughter. The festival marks the acceptance and celebration of death in a positive way,
           as an inevitable part of life. Every family who has lost a member, in the previous year, 
           is supposed to lead an intricately decorated cow through the city. In the absence of a cow, 
           a boy dressed as a cow can take on the role.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is a celebration of life and death, and a reminder of the fleeting nature of existence. 
          The festival is a time to remember and honor the deceased, and to come to terms with the reality of death and loss.
           It also serves as a reminder to live fully and make the most of the time we have, for it is uncertain when our time 
           will come. The cows that are paraded during the festival symbolize the journey of the soul, and the belief that all 
           living beings will eventually return to the earth. Gai Jatra is a profound and meaningful tradition that encourages
            reflection on the deeper aspects of life, death and the human condition.

        <h4>Active Region:<span>Terai Region, Kathmandu, Nationwide</span></h4>
        <p>Krishna Janmashtami is a celebration to mark the birth of Krishna. 
          Considered the eighth incarnation of Lord Vishnu, Krishna is the most important character in the Hindu epic – 
          the Mahabharat. During this festival, Hindu devotees visit Krishna temples. In particular,

          It is believed that Lord Krishna is the embodiment of love, compassion and wisdom,

            the celebration of Janmashtami serves as a reminder to strive for self-improvement and to seek inner peace, 
            enlightenment and the ultimate realization of one's true self. The festival also encourages to reflect on the idea of 
            the divine and its manifestation in the world around us, and to embrace the spiritual path of devotion and surrender 
            to the ultimate reality.

        <h3>Solar Calender : <span>August - September</span></h3>
        <h4>Active Region : <span>Nationwide</span></h4>
        <p>Teej is a festival celebrated exclusively by Nepali women, with festivities often stretching over 
          3 days around the month of August. Dressed in red saris and a red tika, the women sing and dance for the long lives
           of their husbands, and a long and firm relationship until death parts them. Teej is observed for marital happiness,
            the well-being of spouse and children, and the purification of own body and soul. Teej is the most famous festival
             among Nepali women.
        </p>
        <p>
          Teej is a festival that celebrates the onset of monsoon and the reunion of Lord Shiva and Goddess Parvati.
           But it goes beyond just the celebration of a natural event, it's also an opportunity to reflect on the cyclical 
           nature of life. It reminds us that just as the rains bring new life to the earth, so too can we strive to rejuvenate 
            ourselves. The festival encourages us to let go of the past and embrace the present, to let go of the negative 
            and welcome the positive, and to celebrate the beauty of nature and the sanctity of relationships. Teej reminds us that,
             like the monsoon, life is a cycle of birth, growth, decay, and rebirth, and that by embracing and celebrating these 
             changes, we can find true joy and fulfillment.

        <h4>Active Region : <span>Kathmandu</span></h4>
        <p>Indra Jatra is a colourful street festival held each year in Kathmandu, in honour of the Hindu god Indra.
           The celebrations consist of two events; Indra Jatra with its masked dances of deities and demons, and Kumari Jatra 
           which is a chariot procession for the living goddess Kumari.

          Centred around Kathmandu Durbar Square, the celebrations last for eight days. 
          This is also a time for family members who have died during the past year to be remembered
        </p>
        <p>
          Indra Jatra, also known as Yenya, is a festival celebrated in Nepal and by the Newar community in Nepal. 
          The festival is celebrated in honor of Lord Indra, the god of rain and fertility, and is intended to ensure
           a bountiful harvest. On a deeper philosophical level, however, the celebration of Indra Jatra can be seen as
            a reminder of the cyclical nature of life and the importance of understanding the interconnectedness of all things.
             The festival serves as a reminder that, just as the rains are necessary for the growth of crops and the sustenance
              of life, so too are the struggles and hardships that we face necessary for our growth and development as individuals.
               It is also a reminder that everything is interconnected and that everything we do has an impact on the world around 
               us.

        <h4>Active Region : <span>Nationwide</span></h4>
        <p>Dashain is the most important festival to Nepalis, and stretches over 2 weeks with various stages and events.
           It is a celebration of good prevailing over evil, and most families offer male goats, ducks, chickens, eggs and 
           coconuts to the goddess Durga.

          Many Nepali people return to their home villages at this time to spend the fifteen-day festival with their families.
           Large swings are set up for children, and from the tenth day, family members receive Tika (rice, red vermillion and
            yoghurt) on their foreheads from their elders.
        </p>
        <p>
          Bijaya Dashami is a festival that symbolizes the victory of good over evil, and the triumph of knowledge over ignorance.
           This festival has a deep philosophical significance as it reminds us that in life, we will face many obstacles and 
           challenges. But with determination, perseverance and knowledge, we can overcome them and be victorious. 
           The festival is also a reminder that the path to victory is not easy, it requires continuous effort and the willingness
            to learn and grow. The festival also teaches us that the ultimate victory is not just about external achievements but
             also about inner growth and self-realization. Therefore, Bijaya Dashami is a call to reflect on our own inner battles
              and to strive for victory over our own limitations.

           were committed during the previous year. Through the celebration of Tihar, we are reminded that the choices we make,
            and the actions we take, have a profound impact on the world around us. It is a time to be mindful of our actions 
            and to strive for compassion, kindness, and understanding in our interactions with others.

          performing the rituals of Chhath, one can attain blessings of health, prosperity, and well-being.
           From a philosophical perspective, Chhath can be seen as a celebration of the power of nature and the importance 
           of gratitude and humility. By humbling ourselves before the Sun, we are reminded of our small place in the grand 
           scheme of things and the need to be thankful for the blessings we receive. It also highlights the importance of
            balance between human and nature and how the nature's power could be used for human well-being.

        <p>Lhosar is widely celebrated by Nepalese ethnic groups who trace their heritage to Tibet – namely the Gurung,
           Tamang and Sherpa people. Lhosar is the first day of the new year, and each community celebrates the festival 
           in their own way. Traditional dress is worn by young and old, and festivities are held across the country in 
           cities and more remote regions.
        </p>
        <p>
          Lhosar, also known as Losar, is a traditional festival celebrated by the Tibetan people.
           It marks the start of the Tibetan New Year and is a time of renewal and hope. On a philosophical level,
            Lhosar can be seen as a reminder of the cyclical nature of time and the importance of letting go of the past 
            and embracing the future. It is a time to reflect on one's actions and to make amends for any mistakes made in
             the past year. The festival also serves as a reminder that all things are impermanent, and that we must strive
              to make the most of the present moment. Lhosar is a celebration of the human spirit and its ability to overcome
               challenges and start anew.

          temple in Kathmandu, where thousands of Sadhus (Hindu holy men) gather to smoke marijuana and hashish, considered 
          dear to Lord Shiva. People also drink Bhang, a drink made by mixing ground nuts, spices, herbs and extracts of 
          marijuana into milk.

        <h3>Solar Calender : <span>February - March</span></h3>
        <h4>Active Region : <span>Nationwide</span></h4>
        <p>Perhaps the best-known festival on this list, Holi is a crazily colourful and playful event held over 2 days. 
          It is celebrated in the Terai on one day, and in Kathmandu and the hill regions on the next day. 
          People smear coloured powders on their friends, relatives and family members, as well as taking
           part in giant water fights using coloured water and water balloons.
        </p>
        <p>
          Holi, also known as the Festival of Colors, is a Hindu festival that symbolizes the triumph of good over evil,
           and the arrival of spring. It is celebrated by people of all ages, and is a time for forgiveness, coming 
           together with loved ones, and spreading joy and love. On a philosophical level, Holi reminds us that just 
           as the colors of spring bring new life and vitality to the world, we too have the ability to bring new life 
           and vitality to our relationships, our communities, and ourselves. Through the act of forgiveness, we can 
           let go of past hurt and grudges, and by coming together with loved ones, we can strengthen the bonds of love
            and friendship. The festival of Holi, therefore, is not just a celebration of the arrival of spring, but a 
            celebration of the power of love and forgiveness to bring new life and vitality to our world.

           The horse, a powerful and majestic animal, symbolizes the potential for greatness within us all. As the horse is 
           paraded through the streets, we are reminded that we too must embrace our own power and potential, and strive to
            become the best version of ourselves. Ghode Jatra is not just a celebration of the horse, but of the human spirit 
            and our ability to overcome obstacles and achieve great things. It is a reminder that we are all connected and 
            that our actions, no matter how small, have the power to shape the world around us.
